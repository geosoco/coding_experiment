					<h1>Rumor and Labels</h1>

					<h2>Rumor definition</h2>
					<h4>Suicide Bomber / Bomb belt, backpack, or vest</h4>
					<p>This rumor claims someone was a suicide bomber or that they had an explosive device in backpacks, vests, or belts.</p>


					<h2>Applying Labels</h2>
					<p>You will be applying two sets of labels. These must be applied differently. The first set consists of 3 labels and only one should be applied to each tweet. The second set consists of just 1 label, and should be applied whenever you feel it applies.</p>

					<h3>Affirmation or Denial</h3>
					<p>The first set of labels describes whether the tweet affirms or denies the rumor. You should label any tweet that supports or just passes along this information as <span class="label label-default label-Affirm">Affirm</span> label. Any tweet that denies or questions the presence of a bomb or the ability of the person to be a suicide bomber should be labeled  <span class="label label-default label-Deny">Deny</span> label. In rare cases, the tweet will neither affirm nor deny the rumor. You should label these <span class="label labe-default label-Neutral">Neutral</span>. 
					</p>

					<div class="alert alert-warning">
						<strong>You must apply ONLY one of these for each tweet.</strong>
					</div>					

					<table class="table" style="margin: 40px 10px;">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Label</th>
								<th>Keyboard</th>
								<th>Definition</th>
								<th>Example</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>

							<tr>
								<td><span class="label label-default label-Affirm">Affirm</span></td>
								<td><span class="keyboard-btn">1</span></td>
								<td>This tweet affirms, supports, and functions to pass along the story. </td>
								<td>@KevinZZ The hostage-taker has a bomb in his backpack. #Sydney #SydneySiege</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><span class="label label-default label-Neutral">Neutral</span></td>
								<td><span class="keyboard-btn">2</span></td>
								<td>The tweet is exactly neutral (use sparingly). Be careful not to conflate with an implicit affirmation.</td>
								<td>RT @JillSmith: CNN has a picture of the hostage taker.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><span class="label label-default label-Deny">Deny</span></td>
								<td><span class="keyboard-btn">3</span></td>
								<td>This tweet denies or questions all or part of the story.</td>
								<td>I don't see any sign of a bomb or backpack in that picture. #sydneysiege</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>


					<h3>Uncertainty</h3>
					<p>Additionally, another label should be applied to every tweet that expresses uncertainty about the information.</p>

					<table class="table" style="margin: 20px;">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Label</th>
								<th>Keyboard</th>
								<th>Definition</th>
								<th>Example</th>
							</tr>						
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td><span class="label label-Uncertainty">Uncertainty</span></td>
								<td><span class="keyboard-btn">4</span></td>
								<td>This tweet expresses some level of uncertainty about the story. This refers to a property of the tweet itself, not your uncertainty. In other words, the tweet suggests that the veracity of the story is not 100% resolved. (This code refers to a relationship between the tweetâ€™s author and the rumor/story - i.e. the tweet author expresses uncertainty in the tweet). [Not me, them]
								</td>								
								<td>Is no one else concerned there might be a bomb in that backpack? #Sydney</td>
							</tr>
