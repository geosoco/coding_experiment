					<h2>Rumor definition</h2>
					<h4>Suicide Bomber / Bomb belt, backpack, or vest</h4>
					<p>This rumor claims someone was a suicide bomber or that they had an explosive device in backpacks, vests, or belts.</p>


					<h2>Applying Labels</h2>
					<p>You will be applying one set of labels. This set consists of 3 labels and only one should be applied to each tweet.  </p>

					<h3>Affirmation or Denial</h3>
					<p>This set of labels describes whether the tweet affirms or denies the rumor. You should label any tweet that supports or just passes along this information as <span class="label label-default label-Affirm">Affirm</span> label. Any tweet that denies or questions the presence of a bomb or the ability of the person to be a suicide bomber should be labeled  <span class="label label-default label-Deny">Deny</span> label. In rare cases, the tweet will not affirm or deny the rumor. You should label these <span class="label labe-default label-Neutral">Neutral</span>. </p>
