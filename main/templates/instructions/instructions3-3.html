								<td>This tweet expresses some level of uncertainty about the story. This refers to a property of the tweet itself, not your uncertainty. In other words, the tweet suggests that the veracity of the story is not 100% resolved. (This code refers to a relationship between the tweetâ€™s author and the rumor/story - i.e. the tweet author expresses uncertainty in the tweet). [Not me, them]
